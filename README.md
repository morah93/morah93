I'm a software engineer with experience in JavaScript, Python, React, Flask and other libraries. My main project right now is a dream come true for a photography enthusiast like myself. I have created a website where a user can post their images and share their creativity and passion with others like them. On the side, I'm working on a group project with other like minded engineers, pair programming on a music hosting website that uses AWS to host the music.

On a more personal note, I'm addicted to gaming and sports. My favorite game currently is Rocket league. It pushes me to give it my all and not give up when I'm repeatedly beaten. Qualities I find quite applicable while coding.

Additional Skills: Javascript - SQL - HTML5 - CSS3 - Python - Flask - React.js - Redux - Express.js.

Whether it's photography, gaming, or sports, I have a creative side to me that I have always enjoyed exploring, so I’m happy I am able to do that with software development. I love learning new technology and challenging myself to think logically, methodically, and creatively. When building an idea, a user’s experience is very important to me, so I strive to craft an interface that is innovative, visually appealing, and intuitive for everyone.

As a full stack software developer, I have enjoyed using JavaScript, React/Redux, Python, PostgreSQL, CSS, and HTML in my projects. Currently, I'm self-learning AWS. I'm always finding time to learn more!
